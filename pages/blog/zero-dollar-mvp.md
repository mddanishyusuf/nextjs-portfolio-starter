# Zero dollar MVPs

Today I finished the development of my 3rd project of this year that is https://dailyhack.xyz without investing any amount into servers and marketing.

You were thinking about the time I’m investing in the products building?

Yes, I invest my time and time is valuable but I’m learning many things while doing all these kinds of stuff. So, implementing these experiences into client works.

### List of Products

Here I’m listing products which I built this year and launched on ProductHunt.

1. https://public-apis.xyz
2. https://react-index.com
3. https://dailyhack.xyz

Here I’ll list the technologies and tools I used to build for all above three projects.

### Public APIs Tech Stack:

Public APIs is a database for public, free and private APIs for software development like Weather API, Music API, Games and Comics API, Sports API, Science API, Open Data API, etc.

Here what I used to build this website with no cost.

1. ReactJS: To build the interface(Front-end). https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app
2. Material-UI: React Components to Give a Material Design Feel. https://material-ui.com
3. mLab: Online MongoDB Hosting(Free up to 500mb). https://mlab.com
4. Glitch.com: The best online tool available in the market to quickly build node applications and their servers are so fast. I’m using hosting node APIs to communicate with mLab. https://glitch.com
5. Firebase: GitHub SSO (aka) Single sign-on and using firebase database to store users saved APIs. https://firebase.google.com/
6. Netlify: The backbone of any application is servers. where to host? So, I’m using this famous service to host my react application and hooking with a GitHub repository to automatically deploy. https://www.netlify.com/
7. MailChimp: For sending weekly newsletters it’s free up to 2000 subscribers and 12000 monthly emails. https://mailchimp.com

### React Index Tech Stack:

It’s a platform of React Knowledge Resources only to React as Podcast, Tools, Tutorials, Books, Communities, Projects, React Native, etc.

The tech stack is the same as for public-APIs.

### Dailyhack Tech Stack:

It’s a community where Developers, Makers, and Geeks share there hacks/tricks they use in their daily life while developments and building stuff. It’s my best project that I build.

I used a different stack to build this product from previous tech stack. Here is the list.

1. Next.js: It’s an Open Source Project that supports Server Side Rendering for the ReactJS applications. Yes, no external configuration required. https://nextjs.org
2. GitHub Issues System: Yes, you can use the GitHub Issues System as CMS. So, I’m using this to store dailyhack post as every new issue with a tag #dailyhack.
3. GitHub API: To get the issues list to display on the website.
4. Glitch.com: Using to make a layer on the top of GitHub APIs for securing GitHub
5. Styled JSX: To Design I’m using CSS inside JavaScript. https://nextjs.org/blog/styling-next-with-styled-jsx
6. Zeit: To host this SSR(Server Side Rendering) Application I’m using Zeit Hosting free tier that is enough for my requirement and it’s awesome due to It’s the now-cli tool. You can publish the website just one command now`. https://zeit.co

You know what? It’s Open Source Project https://github.com/mddanishyusuf/dailyhack. So, you can check out the full code of the website.

If you liked my hack in building products without any cost, then a clap will be appreciated. So, what hack do you use for building your products? Please let me know in the comments.
