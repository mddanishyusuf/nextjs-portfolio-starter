# OSS contribution

I‚Äôve been working on my company project that is a dashboard where data is scattered into the form of charts, graph and some cool interaction when end user lands on the dashboard.

there was a module where admin schedule the test for users by selecting multiple dates and schedule that‚Äôs all. So, I was looking an Angular 6 date component that can select multiple dates.

I browse multiple blog post, GitHub projects but didn‚Äôt find any work around solution.

Finally I found a GitHub Project that was providing the module for selecting date but only you can select one date. So, I decide to edit the code according to my requirement.

So, Finally by some line of code the multiple selection date components is build and My task is delivered on time and felling happy.

Suddenly an idea hit my mind that why don‚Äôt make the contribution to this 1.2k start open source projects.

As a newbie I draft an email about the contribution that I wanna add a multiple selection module into this project. So, I want to contribute into your project. Here is screenshot of that email.
Drafted Email to Matt.

You know, I was not expected that he will reply on my email But surpisingly he replied after couple of hours and he said great! send me the PR that‚Äôs all. When I was reading the email and at the same time I was thinking to optimize code more. So, that in first PR code will approved.

First I forked the repository to my account then clone the code locally and start writing the code like a professional programmers and after 3 hours work made a fresh PR.

I got response on the PR thread that Awesome, thanks üëç
